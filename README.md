# Minesweeper
From Wikipedia: Minesweeper is a logic puzzle video game generally played on personal computers. The game features a grid of clickable squares, with hidden "mines" scattered throughout the board. The objective is to clear the board without detonating any mines, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field. The minesweeper grid in the program is 8x8 and contains 10 mines.
